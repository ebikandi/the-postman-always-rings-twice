## It is requested:

## Observations:

* Choose the language you feel very comfortable writing real code.
* **Do not use frameworks (do not use Grails, Spring, Rails, Django nor similar ones. Do not use data bases, keep it simple). We want to see your code ;)**
* We appreciate good practices and design patterns, so take care of concepts like modularization, extensibility, maintenance among others.
* Make your code readable.
* Implement the most eficient data structures and algorithms that better fit to solve the problem.
* Let us know how to run your code.
* Extra ball: testing is more than welcome.
